## Bridging the Gap: Full Stack Development with HTMX and Spring Boot Showcase

![Spring Boot + HTMX banner image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/13824/1*aj8Tc_O_5KiIYxSrGh2H4g.png)

Welcome, fellow developers, to a journey into the fascinating world of web development, where we‚Äôre about to embark on the creation of something truly engaging ‚Äî our very own ASCII art generator! Picture this: taking ordinary text and transforming it into captivating visual art. Exciting, right? In this article, we‚Äôll be diving into the collaborative magic of HTMX and Spring Boot to make this vision a reality.

HTMX is like the wizard‚Äôs wand of modern web development, known for its simplicity and user-friendly approach. It seamlessly connects the front end and back end, making it a perfect companion for crafting interactive experiences. Now, pair that with the robustness of the Spring Boot framework, and you‚Äôve got a powerhouse combination ready to unleash creativity. To learn more about HTMX you can check out [https://htmx.org/](https://htmx.org/)

Our main goal? To build an ASCII art generator that adds a touch of flair to plain text. Imagine typing in your favorite quote or a simple message, and watching it transform into a visually stunning piece of ASCII art. It‚Äôs not just about coding ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating an experience that brings joy and creativity to the user.

Throughout this exploration, we‚Äôll uncover the intricacies of this dynamic collaboration. We‚Äôll bridge the gap between the server and the browser, demonstrating how these technologies work hand in hand to create a unique and interactive web application. We will focus on making the process accessible, enjoyable, and, most importantly, user-friendly.

So, Let‚Äôs get started! Let us head over to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) and configure the project as shown below:

![Project setup](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3322/1*ENUF94T3hIa2iQzYFLE_oQ.png)

We are going to be using Java 17 for this project. The dependencies that we are using here are :

**Spring Web: **It provides essential components such as controllers, the DispatcherServlet, and View Resolver, facilitating the organization of HTTP request handling and the implementation of the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.

**Thymeleaf**: Thymeleaf, a server-side Java template engine, is a key dependency often coupled with Spring Boot‚Äôs web development. Functioning as a view template engine, Thymeleaf empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages by embedding expressive constructs directly within HTML templates.

We are going to be using a library called **Banana** which is a FIGlet utility for Java that generates text banners, in a variety of typefaces, composed of letters made up of conglomerations of smaller ASCII characters. You can check it out here: [https://github.com/yihleego/banana](https://github.com/yihleego/banana)

Now let us open the project in the IDE of your choice. I am going to be using Intellij Idea.

Add the Banana library dependency to your pom.xml as well.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.leego</groupId>
      <artifactId>banana</artifactId>
      <version>2.1.0</version>
    </dependency>

Now let's get started on coding the application. Please use the below folder structure for reference

I have created the UI template in the template directory which looks something like this (index.html)

This file represents the web page for an ASCII Art Generator, incorporating the Tailwind CSS framework for styling and the HTMX library for seamless interaction between the front end and back end. Let‚Äôs break down the key components and functionality of the code:

- The Tailwind CSS stylesheet is linked from a CDN for styling purposes.

- The HTMX library is linked to a CDN. HTMX is used for making dynamic requests and updating the page content without a full page reload.

We are using several HTMX tags here starting from top

1.  **hx-get**: The hx-get attribute specifies a URL (/api/fonts) to make an HTTP GET request when the event specified hx-trigger occurs.

2.  **hx-trigger**: This hx-trigger="load" indicates that the GET request should be triggered when the page loads.

3.  **hx-target**: Thehx-target="#font-select" designates the HTML element with the ID font-select as the target for updating with the response from the GET request. In this case, it loads font options dynamically into a dropdown.

4.  **hx-post**: The hx-post attribute specifies a URL (/api/ascii-art) to make an HTTP POST request when the button is clicked.

5.  **hx-swap**: The hx-swap="outerHTML" indicates that the entire content of the target element should be replaced with the response from the POST request.

These are the tags we used here in addition to that we are using the below JavaScript functions to modify the page behaviour

1.  **copyToClipboard** Function:

    function copyToClipboard() {
    const el = document.createElement('textarea');
    el.value = document.getElementById('ascii-art').textContent;
    document.body.appendChild(el);
    el.select();
    document.execCommand('copy');
    console.log("Copied to clipboard");
    document.body.removeChild(el);
    }

- This function is responsible for copying the text content of the ASCII art to the clipboard.

- It creates a new `textarea` element, sets its value to the text content of the `#ascii-art` element, appends the `textarea` to the document body, selects the content, executes the ‚Äòcopy‚Äô command, logs a message to the console, and removes the `textarea` from the document body.

2. **downloadFile** Function:

   function downloadFile() {
   const asciiArtContent = document.getElementById('ascii-art').textContent;
   const blob = new Blob([asciiArtContent], { type: 'text/plain' });
   const downloadLink = document.createElement('a');
   downloadLink.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
   downloadLink.download = 'ascii_art.txt';
   document.body.appendChild(downloadLink);
   downloadLink.click();
   document.body.removeChild(downloadLink);
   }

- This function is responsible for generating a downloadable file containing the ASCII art.

- It retrieves the text content of the `#ascii-art` element, creates a `Blob` (binary large object) containing the text, creates a link (`<a>`) with a URL pointing to the Blob, sets the download attribute to ‚Äòascii_art.txt‚Äô, appends the link to the document body, triggers a click on the link, and removes the link from the document body.

3. **adjustButtonVisibility** Function:

   function adjustButtonVisibility() {
   const asciiArt = document.getElementById('ascii-art');
   const copyButton = document.getElementById('copyButton');
   const downloadButton = document.getElementById('downloadButton');
   copyButton.style.display = asciiArt.textContent.trim() ? 'inline-block' : 'none';
   downloadButton.style.display = asciiArt.textContent.trim() ? 'inline-block' : 'none';
   }

- This function dynamically adjusts the visibility of the copy and download buttons based on the content of the ASCII art.

- It checks whether the trimmed text content of the `#ascii-art` element is non-empty. If it is, the buttons are set to be displayed (`‚Äôinline-block‚Äô`), otherwise, they are set to be hidden (`‚Äônone‚Äô`).

Now we have the UI ready we need to create the APIs /api/ascii-art and /api/fonts . We will use the PageController as below for this:
{% gist https://gist.github.com/MaheshBabu11/951b57a534f7ca148921b66d46943fc1.js %}
Certainly! Let‚Äôs break down the functionality of both APIs defined in the provided Java code:

1.  /api/fonts :
    This API is called to provide a list of font options that can be used in the ASCII art generator. It retrieves a list of font names from the **Font** enum, which is part of the Banana library. Using Java Stream API, it maps each font name to an HTML _<option>_ element and appends them to a _StringBuilder_. The method returns the concatenation of these _<option>_ elements as a single HTML string.

2.  /api/ascii-art :
    This API takes user input text and the selected font as parameters and generates ASCII art accordingly. It uses the BanaUtils.bananaify method is then used to generate ASCII art based on the input text and selected font. The generated ASCII art is wrapped in a _<pre>_ HTML tag.

Now that we have the code let's run the application. Once the application is started you can go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and try out the application.

Also, It‚Äôs deployed on render if you want to try it out [https://ascii-art-generator.maheshbabu11.dev/](https://ascii-art-generator.maheshbabu11.dev/)

In this article, we‚Äôve built an ASCII art generator using HTMX and Spring Boot. HTMX makes our web pages more interactive, and Spring Boot provides a robust backend. With these, we‚Äôve created a tool where users can input text, choose fonts, and instantly generate ASCII art. This project showcases the simplicity and power of combining HTMX and Spring Boot for dynamic and engaging web applications.

Happy Coding üòä!!! Leave a üëè if you enjoyed reading it.
