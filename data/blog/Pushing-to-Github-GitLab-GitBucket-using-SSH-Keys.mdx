As the days of the username and password authentication for pushing to GitHub repositories have depreciated, there is a need for a new method to authenticate users using git while pushing data. The use of SSH keys can come to the rescue in this situation. In this article, I will show you how to do this.

## Steps to setup authentication using SSH key :

## 1. Check GIT.

Make sure that you have git installed on your computer.

## 2. Create a repo.

Make sure there is at least one file in it (even just the README.md)

## 3. Generate an SSH key pair (private/public):

You can do this by using the following command.
```command
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```
or by using an even better method.
```command
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
## 4. Copy the contents of the public SSH key

In order to copy the content of the SSH key file that you have created. Do the following steps :

In macOS:
```command
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
GNU/Linux (requires the xclip package):
```command
    xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Windows Command Line:
```command
    type %userprofile%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | clip
```
Git Bash on Windows / Windows PowerShell:
```command
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
```
or of course copy it via your favorite editor, cat, or whatever suits your needs :)

Here id_rsa.pub is the file that stores your public key. You can rename it if you want.

## 5. Copy the public SSH key to GitHub

Copy the contents of your SSH keys to your GitHub account settings ([https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)).

1. Go to settings from your account.

4. Copy the contents of the file id_rsa.pub(in this case) that you have created and paste it into the key box and also insert a suitable title. Then click add SSH key.

## 5. Test the SSH key:

To tesh, the SSH key that you have generated is valid perform the command as below.
```command
    ssh -T git@github.com
```
Change directory into the local clone of your repository (if youâ€™re not already there) and run:
```command
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
```
Now try editing a file (try the README) and then do:
```commands
    git add -A
    git commit -am "Update README.md"
    git push
```
You should not be asked for a username or password. If it works, your SSH key is correctly configured.
