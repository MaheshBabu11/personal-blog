Then you have come to the right place, I will show you how you can add a profile readme to your GitHub profile and make your profile stand out among the crowd.

## ***What is a profile readme**?*

Your profile readme tells people the story of your work through the repositories that you are interested in, the contributions that you have made, and the conversations that you have had. It's a single-page resume where you summarize about yourself.

You decide what information to include in your profile README, so you have full control over how you present yourself on GitHub. Here are some examples of information that visitors may find interesting, fun, or useful in your profile README.

* An ‚ÄúAbout me‚Äù section that describes your work and interests

* Contributions you‚Äôre proud of, and context about those contributions

* Guidance for getting help in communities where you‚Äôre involved

## Prerequisites

GitHub will display your profile README on your profile page if all of the following are true.

* You‚Äôve created a repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.

* The repository is public.

* The repository contains a file named README.md in its root.

* The README.md file contains any content.

## Steps to add a README to your profile

* In the upper-right corner of any page, use the drop-down menu, and select New Repository.
