Let’s start with their flagship product, the Framework Laptop. This laptop is not your average device. It’s designed to be easily disassembled, allowing you to repair and upgrade it with ease. No more frustration over a broken component that renders your entire laptop useless! Framework Laptop received a perfect repairability score of 10 out of 10 from iFixit, making it a true standout in the industry.

But what really sets Framework Computer apart is their unwavering commitment to the electronics right to repair movement. They understand that consumer electronics shouldn’t be disposable, and they’re here to prove it. By offering laptops with replaceable parts, they’re empowering users to take control of their devices and extend their lifespan.

The company’s dedication to repairability has garnered recognition from renowned experts and media outlets.
